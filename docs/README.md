# Functional Programming Concepts Applied Using C# #

You have been curious about all the fuss in recent years
about functional programming? but have not found how
to apply it in your day to day work.
This post aims to give you a cheatsheet with functional concepts
and techniques used in the .NET framework.

## Conclusion ##

I hope that this post has helped you to understand
more about the Functional Programming paradigm and how we can use it
in our projects, to improve `readability`, `testability` and `correctness`
of our software. Remember that FP and OOP are orthogonal and you can use
the best of both worlds.
